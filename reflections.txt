You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  HTML tags mostly
  * What has been easy?
  Pretty much everything
  * What has been difficult?
  Nothing really - see below
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  Nope, because I've done this project after I've completed projects that I was supposed to do after this one. So this one was easy for me.
